# cylPiston
This' case geometry is created with blockMesh utility. You can use [blockMeshDict.m4](https://github.com/StasF1/dualFuelEngine/blob/master/tutorials/dyMFoam/cylPiston/system/blockMeshDict.m4) macros to set engine geometry parameters ). Dimensions
which used at the blockMeshDict.m4 represented on the scheme below:
