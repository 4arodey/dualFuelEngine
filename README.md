# About dualFuelEngine
OpenFOAM solver based on phenomenological compression model for dual-fuel ship engines.

# Requirements
- OpenFOAM v6 or higher (preferred)
- OpenFOAM v5 (check the [issue #6](https://github.com/StasF1/dualFuelEngine/issues/6))

# Usage
## Installation
1. Set path to install and save it as OpenFOAM variable (optional, if OpenFOAM installed by default requires sudo)
	```bash
	FOAM_ADDITIONS="\$HOME/\$WM_PROJECT" # path to install (~/OpenFOAM by default)
	sudo sed -i "s+# Convenience+# Convenience\nexport FOAM_ADDITIONS=$FOAM_ADDITIONS+g" $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/config.sh/settings
	```

3. To compile with OpenFOAM v6 or higher
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/StasF1/dualFuelEngine.git $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine
	$FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/solvers/./Allwmake
	```
	
4. To compile with OpenFOAM v5.x
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/StasF1/dualFuelEngine.git $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine
	$FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/etc/./v5x-compile
	$FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/solvers/./Allwmake
	```

## Running
```bash
wmake $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/./Allclean && $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/./Allrun
```

### Re-wmake and rerun by cases
- RiemannTube case
    ```bash
    wmake $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/solvers/multiCompression && $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/multiCompression/RiemannTube/./Allclean && $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/multiCompression/RiemannTube/./Allrun || cat $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/multiCompression/RiemannTube/log.multiCompression
    ```
- quadPiston case
    ```bash
    wmake $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/solvers/multiCompression && $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/multiCompression/quadPiston/./Allclean && $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/multiCompression/quadPiston/./Allrun || cat $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/multiCompression/quadPiston/log.multiCompression
    ```
- cylPiston case
    ```bash
    wmake $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/solvers/multiCompression && $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/multiCompression/cylPiston/./Allclean && $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/multiCompression/cylPiston/./Allrun || cat $FOAM_ADDITIONS/dualFuelEngine/tutorials/multiCompression/cylPiston/log.multiCompression
    ```
